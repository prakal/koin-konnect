In order to make the content and advertising as informative and useful as possible, we may use information about your relationship with us (such as types of accounts, transactional information or the state in which you bank). Currently, for online advertising purposes, our website does not respond to browser &ldquo;do not track&rdquo; signals, but these signals may be used for fraud prevention. &nbsp;However, if you choose, you can set your website browser to inform you when cookies are sent or you may choose not to accept cookies. Your decision not to accept cookies could limit access to some of the services and offers that are available on our website. &nbsp;For example, your device may not be recognized when you visit our website and, if you are an online banking customer, you may need to answer challenge questions each time you log on. &nbsp;You also may not receive advertising or other offers from us that may be of interest to you.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3 c19">Mobile </span><span class="c1">and Voice Devices</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Some mobile/Voice devices come with a non-permanent advertising identifier or ID which gives companies the ability to serve targeted ads to a specific mobile device. &nbsp;In many cases, you can turn off mobile device ad tracking or you can reset the advertising identifier at any time within your mobile device privacy settings. &nbsp;You may also choose to turn off location tracking on your mobile/Voices device if available. &nbsp;By turning off ad tracking or location tracking on your mobile device, you may still see the same number of ads as before, but they may be less relevant because they will not be based on your interests.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Email</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">We may reserve the right to send you information about our services or in the case of any disruption.
