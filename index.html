You don’t have to link your Coinbase™ Account to use the KoinKonnect skill, if you choose not to.</strong> Once you’ve enabled the KoinKonnect skill, you can ask Alexa to check your portfolio balance from your Coinbase™ account, get market info and news about cryptocurrencies. Please note KoinKonnect Skill is not liable for service disruptions or the accuracy of the information provided by third parties (such as Coinbase™ or CoinMarketCap). When you make a request to the KoinKonnect skill (a “User Request”), you will receive a voice response from the KoinKonnect skill and a record of the voice interaction (an “Alexa Card”) may appear in the Alexa companion app (the “Alexa App”).
