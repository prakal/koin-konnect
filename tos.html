          Welcome to the KoinKonnect skill for Amazon Alexa brought to you by  VoiceConnect LLC.<br>
          What is it? The KoinKonnect skill from VoiceConnect LLC is a voice-driven capability that enables you to access certain information linked to your Coinbase™ online account on devices that connect to the Alexa Voice Service (“Alexa”), like the Amazon Echo. <strong>Please note that KoinKonnect Skill from VoiceConnect LLC is not affiliated with Coinbase™ or any of its affiliated company. You don’t have to link your Coinbase™ Account to use the KoinKonnect skill, if you choose not to.</strong> Once you’ve enabled the KoinKonnect skill, you can ask Alexa to check your portfolio balance from your Coinbase™ account, get market info and news about cryptocurrencies. Please note KoinKonnect Skill is not liable for service disruptions or the accuracy of the information provided by third parties (such as Coinbase™ or CoinMarketCap). When you make a request to the KoinKonnect skill (a “User Request”), you will receive a voice response from the KoinKonnect skill and a record of the voice interaction (an “Alexa Card”) may appear in the Alexa companion app (the “Alexa App”).

Please do not send us messages through Alexa unless the message is an audio command that the VoiceConnect LLC skill is programmed to recognize.  The KoinKonnect skill is also not intended to be used to dispute anything with Coinbase™ account.<br>
